- Title: Simulate the K-Means Algorithm On 2-Dimensional Space.
- Objective: This project aims to develop a Python implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm for educational purposes. It is a practical exercise to enhance proficiency in Python programming and deepen understanding of the K-means algorithm's mechanics.
- Tools Used:
  + Python for coding and simulation.
  + Libraries such as Pygame, sklearn, and math.
- Tasks:
  + Create interface and buttons using pygame.
  + Create functions for buttons.
  + Create data points on the panel when clicked and create a save-all list.
  + Random clusters (at least 2).
  + Assign color (label) to data points.
  + Change the centroid point position.
  + Calculate the error (sum of all distances of created points to its centroid point, (the smaller the better)).
- Knowledge Utilized:
  + Proficiency in Python programming, including familiarity with syntax, data structures, and control flow.
  + Understanding of the K-means algorithm, including its iterative process of centroid initialization, data point assignment, and centroid updating.
- Project Description:
  + This project involves simulating the K-means clustering algorithm using Python.
  + Although in practice there are few applications of the K-means algorithm, with this algorithm we can effectively learn knowledge about matrices and vectors.
- The K-means algorithm proceeds iteratively:
  + Initial centroids are randomly selected from the dataset.
  + Data points are assigned to the nearest centroid.
  + Centroids are recalculated as the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster.
  + Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until convergence, where centroids no longer change significantly.
  + By visualizing the clustering results, we can assess the algorithm's performance and explore how different choices of 'k' impact the clustering outcome.
- Working Principle:
  + Initialize 'k' centroids randomly.
  + Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
  + Recalculate centroids based on the mean of data points in each cluster.
  + Repeat until centroids stabilize.
